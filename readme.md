# AI-nything
N-ything problem is a modified n-Queens problem. The difference is the considered chesspiece is not onlu the Queen, but also including Knight, Bishoop, and Rook. Just like the n-Queens problem, N-ything problem is to find the combination of chesspiece positiion on 8x8 chessboard with minimum number of attacking chesspieces.
Formally, find the combination of chesspiece so the tuple *(p, q)* where p __attacks_ q is minimum. Note that if p attacks q, it doesn't mean that p attacks p. Note that (p, q) and (q, p) is a completely different tuple
The attacking system on this problem follows the conventional chess rules.
